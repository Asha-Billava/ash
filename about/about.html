                     Dr. B.B.Hegde First Grade College, Kundapura, affiliated to the Mangalore University, 
                        was established in the year 2010 under the aegis of Coondapur Education Society (R.) 
                        with a desire to provide quality degree education for building the future generation 
                        for a better tomorrow. With the dynamic leadership of the President of the Coondapur 
                        Education Society (R), Sri B.M.Sukumar Shetty and the constant support and encouragement 
                        of the managing committee and the governing council, the college could carve a niche for 
                        itself among the renowned institutions affiliated to the Mangalore University.<br>
                  
                    Our aim is to mould the students into knowledgeable and respon
                      sible citizens with character and integrity. We are genuinely interested
                      in the all round development of the students. Therefore, our mission
                      goes beyond academic excellence. In addition to academics, our other
                      concerns are personality development of the students, promotion of in-
                      terest in art and culture among the students, enlightening the minds of
                      the students with enduring social and human values and creating envi-
                      ronmental awareness among them. Our intention is to develop gradu-
                      ates who are dynamic, caring, optimistic and humane. To quote Swami
                      Vivekananda, "We want the education by which character is formed,
                      strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which
                      one can stand on one's own feet" Unquote. We are in pursuit of the holistic
                      approach towards education.We believe "Educating the mind without educating the 
                      heart is no educaton at all".
